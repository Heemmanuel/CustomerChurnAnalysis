# Customer Churn Analysis
### This tutorial explains how to set up and run Jupyter Notebooks from within IBM® Watson™ Studio. We start with a data set for customer churn that is available on Kaggle.

The data set has a corresponding Customer Churn Analysis Jupyter Notebook (originally developed by Sandip Datta), which shows the archetypical steps in developing a machine learning model by going through the following essential steps:

- Import the data set

- Analyze the data by creating visualizations and inspecting basic statistic parameters (for example, mean or standard variation).

- Prepare the data for machine model building (for example, by transforming categorical features into numeric features and by normalizing the data).

- Split the data into training and test data to be used for model training and model validation.

- Train the model by using various machine learning algorithms for binary classification.

- Evaluate the various models for accuracy and precision using a confusion matrix.

- Select the model that’s the best fit for the given data set, and analyze which features have low and significant impact on the outcome of the prediction.
